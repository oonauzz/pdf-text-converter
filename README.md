Instructor: Dr. Anasse Bari

## Learning Objectives

    Practicing exception handling in Java
    Practicing arrays in Java
    Practicing File/IO and unstructured data processing in Java

## Application of File I/O

    File Input/Output (I/O) is crucial for reading and writing data from and to files. In this homework, we delve deeper into File I/O by creating a PDF reader application using Java.
    Step 1: Extract Text Data

    You need to extract text from PDF files. You can either write a Java program or use a Java API for this task.
    Step 2: Format the Text

    Format the extracted text data as per the specified requirements and store it in a text file.
    Step 3: Analyze the Text

    Create an application to analyze the text data from the PDF files. Users can perform tasks like searching for common words, checking word existence, identifying sections, and listing papers associated with a word.
    Requirements

    Parse at least 20 PDFs, including some from the "Challenging to process" folder
    Format text data according to specified guidelines
    Implement text analysis features as described in Step 3
